# Reservation-Cancellation-Prediction
Predict the status of the reservation
Customer behavior and booking possibilities have been radically changed by online hotel reservation channels. Cancellations or no-shows cause a significant number of hotel reservations to be canceled. Cancellations can be caused by a variety of factors, such as scheduling conflicts, changes in plans, etc. In many cases, this is made easier by the possibility of doing so free or at a low cost, which is beneficial for hotel guests but less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing for hotels.

 

As a Data Scientist, your job is to build a Machine Learning model to help the Hotel Owners better understand if the customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel it ?
